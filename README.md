##Summary
This program reads in the CSV file created by the Qualtrics survey software 
and prints out cross-tabulated summaries of the quantities of interest to 
the screen. I know this isn't the best R code ever; I sacrificed speed in 
getting the job done for elegance of the code.

##Inputs
File named _TACC_Demographics_Results.csv_ in the same directory as this file. This repository contains the results file from the 2015 survey (completed 17 August, 2015) which has been modified to preserve anonynmity (IP address and location information is removed).

##Outputs
Summary stats printed to the console.
